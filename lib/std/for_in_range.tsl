# Iterates through a range, yielding each integer in the range.
# Example:
#
#     for i in [0..3]
#       i   #=> 0, 1, 2, 3
#

# the intuitive syntax is preprocessed by the compiler. After processing,
# the logic resembles the following:
#
#     tmp(i): ...
#     for_in_range start, stop, step, :tmp
#
for_in_range(current, stop, step, yield):
  yield current
  if current != stop
    current = current + step
    for_in_range current, stop, step, yield
