###
Single line comments start with one pound ('#'). Multiline comments are denoted with 3 pounds.

This is an indent-sensitive syntax. Indents are used for blocks, while outdents close the block.

Screens are defined at the top level (no indent) with the form [screen name] [colon]. They contain
blocks of code to be evaluated in that screen.

Anywhere else, _references_ to screen names are denoted with [colon] [screen name]. These are used
as arguments to functions, such as goto(:screen_name). The screen name can be referenced as if it
were itself a function, causing the terminal to switch immediately to the specified screen if no
other conditions have tested true.

Variables are defined dynamically based upon their content. Variable types can't be changed, but they
can be cast into other types. If the type cannot be inferred from context, its type will default to
'string'. Variable names can contain periods and underscores.

Keypresses can be checked as part of an if-condition or a switch.
